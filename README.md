# HammingCode in Mojo

A simple implementation of Hamming Code in Mojo, ported from the Python implementation on GeeksForGeeks.

## About

This is a toy project created for learning the Mojo programming language. The implementation focuses on basic string manipulation and iteration concepts in Mojo.

Original Python implementation: [Hamming Code Implementation in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamming-code-implementation-in-python/) by GeeksForGeeks.

## Installation

1. Install the Modular Magic CLI:
```bash
curl -ssL https://magic.modular.com/deb136de-df74-4db9-bd76-cc486569b640 | bash
```

## Running the Code

To run the Hamming Code implementation:

```bash
magic run start
```

## Purpose

- Learning Mojo syntax
- Understanding basic string operations
- Practicing iteration in Mojo
- Getting familiar with type system

## Note

This is not an optimized implementation and is meant for educational purposes only. The code serves as a learning exercise for understanding Mojo's basic features,
and from my curiosity to see how the Python implementation can be ported to Mojo.
